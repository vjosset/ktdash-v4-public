## Getting Started

To run the KTDash Companion App locally, you'll need:

- MySQL database (local or remote)
- A `.env` file with your database credentials
- Seeded core game data (killteams, optypes, weapons, abilities, etc.)

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vjosset/ktdash-v4.git
cd ktdash-v4
```

---

### 2. Set Up Your Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root. You can start by copying the template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to match your MySQL connection:

```env
# Database connection string (adjust username, password, host, db name)
DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:pass@host:3306/ktdashv4"

# Used by NextAuth.js
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 4. Set Up the Database

Create the database and all its tables:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

Seed the database with core game data:

```bash
npm run seed
```

---

### 5. Start the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the app on `http://localhost:7000`.
